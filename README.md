# Minesweeper but you walk on the board

This is a classic Minesweeper, but instead of clicking on the board to reveal tiles, you walk on the board to reveal the tiles.  

The goal is also different - you need to traverse from the bottom to the top of the board, instead of revealing the whole board.

## Keyboard controls

- Arrow keys: movement
- Q, W, E, A, D, Z, X, C - placing flags
