# Minesweeper but you walk on the board

This is a classic Minesweeper, but instead of clicking on the board to reveal tiles, you walk on the board to reveal the tiles.  

The goal is also different - you need to traverse from the bottom to the top of the board, instead of revealing the whole board.

## Design and AI

This is one of many ideas for a game that I wrote in my notebook years ago, but to even make a prototype it would've taken me a long time. Now, with AI available to make this functional prototype it took only a few hours. The code is mostly AI generated.

## Original idea

In my original idea, you would control a character and on each mine you activate, you lose one limb.  
Or have a band of characters walking in a snake like formation, losing the first one when they step on a mine.
