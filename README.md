# Minesweeper but you walk on the board

This is a classic Minesweeper's variant - instead of clicking on the board to reveal tiles, you walk as a character on the board to reveal the tiles.  

The goal is also different - you need to traverse from the bottom to the top of the board, instead of revealing the whole board. Go safely through the minefield.

## Keyboard controls

* Arrow keys: movement. You can move only in four directions.
* Q, W, E, A, D, Z, X, C: placing and removing flags. You can place flags in 8 directions
* Space: Reveal surrounding tiles without flags.

## Progression

When you win, the size od the board grows, when you lose it shrinks. Try to increase the board as much as you can!

## Difficulty

You can choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard. The harder the difficulty, the more mines are present on the board.

## Design and AI

This is one of many ideas for a game that I wrote in my notebook years ago, but to even make a prototype it would've taken me a long time. Now, with AI available to make this functional prototype it took only a few hours. The code is mostly AI generated.

## Original idea

In my original idea, you would control a character and on each mine you activate, you lose one limb.  
Or have a band of characters walking in a snake like formation, losing the first one when they step on a mine.
